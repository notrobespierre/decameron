 Melchisedech, a Jew, by a story of three rings averts agreat danger with which he was menaced by Saladin. When Neifile had brought her story to a close amid the      commendations      of all the company, Filomena, at the queen's behest, thus      began: The story told by Neifile brings to my mind another in      which also a Jew appears, but this time as the hero of a perilous      adventure; and as enough has been said of God and of the truth of      our faith, it will not now be inopportune if we descend to mundane      events and the actions of men. Wherefore I propose to tell you a      story, which will perhaps dispose you to be more circumspect than      you have been wont to be in answering questions addressed to you.       Well ye know, or should know, loving gossips, that, as it often      happens that folk by their own folly forfeit a happy estate and are      plunged in most grievous misery, so good sense will extricate the wise      from extremity of peril, and establish them in complete and assured      peace.  Of the change from good to evil fortune, which folly may      effect, instances abound; indeed, occurring as they do by the thousand      day by day, they are so conspicuous that their recital would      be beside our present purpose. But that good sense may be our      succour in misfortune, I will now, as I promised, make plain to you      within the narrow compass of a little story. Saladin, who by his great valour had from small beginnings made      himself Soldan of Egypt, and gained many victories over kings both      Christian and Saracen, having in divers wars and by divers lavish      displays of magnificence spent all his treasure, and in order to meet      a certain emergency being in need of a large sum of money, and      being at a loss to raise it with a celerity adequate to his necessity,      bethought him of a wealthy Jew, Melchisedech by name, who lent      at usance in Alexandria,  and who, were he but willing, was, as he      believed, able to accommodate him, but was so miserly that he would      never do so of his own accord, nor was Saladin disposed to constrain him      thereto. So great, however, was his necessity that, after pondering      every method whereby the Jew might be induced to be compliant, at      last he determined to devise a colourably reasonable pretext for extorting      the money from him.  So he sent for him, received him affably,      seated him by his side, and presently said to him: \u201c My good man, Ihave heard from many people that thou art very wise, and of greatdiscernment in divine things; wherefore I would gladly know of thee,which of the three laws thou reputest the true law, the law of theJews, the law of the Saracens, or the law of the Christians?\u201d  The Jew,      who was indeed a wise man, saw plainly enough that Saladin meant      to entangle him in his speech, that he might have occasion to harass      him, and bethought him that he could not praise any of the three laws      above another without furnishing Saladin with the pretext which he      sought. So, concentrating all the force of his mind to shape such an      answer as might avoid the snare, he presently lit on what he sought,      saying:        \u201c My lord, a pretty question indeed is this which you propound,and fain would I answer it; to which end it is apposite thatI tell you a story, which, if you will hearken, is as follows:  If Imistake not, I remember to have often heard tell of a great and richman of old time, who among other most precious jewels had in histreasury a ring of extraordinary beauty and value, which by reasonof its value and beauty he was minded to leave to his heirs for ever;for which cause he ordained, that, whichever of his sons was foundin possession of the ring as by his bequest, should thereby be designatehis heir, and be entitled to receive from the rest the honour andhomage due to a superior.  The son, to whom he bequeathed thering, left it in like manner to his descendants, making the likeordinance as his predecessor. In short the ring passed from hand tohand for many generations; and in the end came to the hands ofone who had three sons, goodly and virtuous all, and very obedientto their father, so that he loved them all indifferently.  The ruletouching the descent of the ring was known to the young men, andeach aspiring to hold the place of honour among them did all hecould to persuade his father, who was now old, to leave the ring tohim at his death.  The worthy man, who loved them all equally, andknew not how to choose from among them a sole legatee, promisedthe ring to each in turn, and in order to satisfy all three, caused acunning artificer secretly to make other two rings, so like the first,that the maker himself could hardly tell which was the true ring.So, before he died, he disposed of the rings, giving one privily toeach of his sons;  whereby it came to pass, that after his decease eachof the sons claimed the inheritance and the place of honour, and, hisclaim being disputed by his brothers, produced his ring in witness ofright. And the rings being found so like one to another that itwas impossible to distinguish the true one, the suit to determine thetrue heir remained pendent, and still so remains.  And so, my lord,to your question, touching the three laws given to the three peoplesby God the Father, I answer: Each of these peoples deems itself tohave the true inheritance, the true law, the true commandments ofGod; but which of them is justified in so believing, is a questionwhich, like that of the rings, remains pendent.\u201d  The excellent      adroitness with which the Jew had contrived to evade the snare      which he had laid for his feet was not lost upon Saladin. He therefore      determined to let the Jew know his need, and did so, telling him      at the same time what he had intended to do, in the event of his      answering less circumspectly than he had done. Thereupon the Jew gave the Soldan all the accommodation that      he required, which the Soldan afterwards repaid him in full. He      also gave him most munificent gifts with his lifelong amity and a      great and honourable position near his person.
